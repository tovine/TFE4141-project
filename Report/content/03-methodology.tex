\chapter{Methodology}
%This chapter should discuss the details of your implementation for the assignment. 
%Everything related to \emph{how} things were done should go here.
%Remember to avoid going into too much details, summarize appropriately and try to use figures/charts.
%Make sure you refer to the figures (such as Figure \ref{fig:universe}) and charts you add in the text.
%Avoid putting lots of source code here -- small code snippets are fine if you want to discuss something specific.
\section{Presentation of the solution}
We chose to implement the RSA circuit using one module for the MonPro operation, a datapath module with various registers for storing inputs and intermediate results and a top-level controller module with a state machine and control signals for the datapath.
In order to use Montgomery's algorithm without taking additional parameters, a simplified version of Blakley's algorithm was used to compute
\begin{equation}
    \bar{x}=1*R*mod(n), R=2^{128}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \bar{M}=M*R*mod(n), R=2^{128}
\end{equation}

%Add content in this section that describes how you tested and verified the correctness of your implementation, with respect to the requirements of the assignment.
\section{Verification plan}
- Write a verification plan.\\
- What metrics will you use to decide when you are done verifying?
(pass rate, code coverage, functional coverage).\\
- Demonstrate the use of assertions \\
- What bring up test strategy have you planned?\\ 
- Discuss/Analyze/Conclude\\
\\
Each submodule of the design was verified with its own testbench.
The RSAcore module was verified using the testbenches provided by Ã˜ystein Gjermundnes.
\\
Improvements in the verification plan would have been to use Bitvis library.
