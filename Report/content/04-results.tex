\chapter{Results}
%In this chapter, you should discuss the results you have obtained from your implementation.
%These can be correctness results, i.e whether the implementation behaved as expected, or numerical results that express runtime or energy measurements.
 
\subsection{Synthesis and test on FPGA}

- Measure area and performance

- Prove that the design actually works on FPGA

\subsection{Discussion of the results}
 
Analysis and discussion of problems, solutions and measured results is necessary in order to make the right decisions. Discussion should therefore be integrated into all parts of the report. 

- What is done, what can be improved (future work).
