\chapter{Conclusion}
%This chapter should be a look back at the entire report and summarizing the problem, the solution and the obtained results.
While the project assignment wasn't entirely successful, the submodules were working and yielding output in accordance to that of the corresponding Python models. \\
%The goal was to give experience with implementing algorithms in hardware and verification by simulation, and this part was 
This project was frustrating to debug when it did not work as intended, and the mathematical theory was a bit challenging to understand and use. But taking into account that neither of us have any previous experience with VHDL we came out a lot more enlightened than before, so this was indeed a very educational experience.

%\section{Evaluation of the Assignment}
%You can include comments about the assignment itself here. While this part is not obligatory and not graded, it is valuable feedback to the course staff that can be used to improve the exercises in the future.
